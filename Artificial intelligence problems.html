<h1>Artificial intelligence problems</h1>
<br>
<h3>Conclusion, logical thinking, and the ability to solve problems</h3>
<p>The first researchers in artificial intelligence developed algorithms that simulate the series logical thinking that humans do when solving puzzles, playing table or logical conclusions. In the 1980s and 1990s, AI research led to very successful methods of dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, using concepts of probability and economics.</p>

<h3>Virtual thinking and qualification problem</h3>
<p>Much of what people know are "assumptions." For example, when mentioning birds in a conversation, the human brain usually depicts an animal the size of a fist, singing, and flying. Of course, not all of these specifications apply to all birds. John McCarthy defined this problem in 1969 with the problem of qualifications: for every logical rule that AI researchers are interested in representing, there are several exceptions. Almost nothing can simply be said to be true or not in the way abstract logic requires. Artificial intelligence research has revealed a number of solutions to this problem.</p>
