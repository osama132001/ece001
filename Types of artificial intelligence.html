<h1>Types of artificial intelligence 
</h1>
<br>
<h3>Narrow artificial intelligence modified</h3>
<br>
<p>It is artificial intelligence that specializes in one field. For example, there are artificial intelligence systems that can beat the world champion of chess, and it's the only thing you do.</p>
<br>
<h3>General artificial intelligence modified</h3>
<br>
<p>This type refers to computers with a level of human intelligence in all areas, that is, it can perform any intellectual task that a person can perform. Creating this type of intelligence is much more difficult than the previous type and we have not reached this level yet.</p>
<br>
<h3>Super artificial intelligence modified</h3>
<br>
<p>Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines supreme intelligence as “an idea that is much smarter than the best human minds in almost every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.” Because of this type, the field of artificial intelligence is an interesting field to delve into.</p>
